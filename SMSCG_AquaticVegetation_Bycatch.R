#Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gate Action
#UC-Davis Suisun Marsh Fish Survey
#Otter trawl
#Submerged aquatic vegetation data


#important metadata
#vegetation data collection started 2014

#To do list
#ask for details on how percent area is calculated for Habitat data set of hook and line survey
#add the "non-detect" otter trawl samples
#incorporate survey effort (trawl duration)
#try using UCD trawl WQ data (SpCond, secchi, depth)
#refer to following database tabs: Sample, Depth, TrawlEffort


#required packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor) #function for data frame clean up
library(EDIutils) #download EDI data
library(sf) #working with spatial data
library(deltamapr) #delta base maps
library(ggrepel) #nonoverlapping point labels

#additional data sets needed for analysis----------
#survey effort: need to know SAV volume per unit survey effort (though maybe this is standardized)
#water quality measurements: salinity is key but turbidity would be nice too
